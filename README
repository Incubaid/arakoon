You're either reading this because you downloaded a binary package,
and want to get started on playing with it, or you downloaded the source
tarball, or cloned the repo.  

Getting Started:
RUNNING A SINGLE NODE TEST SERVER:

create the following configuration:
    [global]
    cluster = arakoon_0
    cluster_id = my_cluster 

    [arakoon_0]
    ip = 127.0.0.1
    client_port = 4000
    messaging_port = 4010
    home = /tmp/arakoon_0
    log_dir = /tmp/arakoon_0
    log_level = info

A sample configuration like this can be found in the cfg dir.

You will need to init first starting from Arakoon 2.0: 
'./arakoon.native --init-db arakoon_0' which init node arakoon_0.
After this, Just running './arakoon.native --node arakoon_0' starts a 1 node cluster for you to play with.

You can get/set values from the command line using :
./arakoon.native --set key value  
./arakoon.native --get key

to get an overview of what else the command line provides.
./arakoon.native --help

have fun,

The arakoon team
